Affenpinscher,"The Affen’s apish look has been described many ways. They’ve been called “monkey dogs” and “ape terriers.” The French say diablotin moustachu (“mustached little devil”), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. “This isn’t a breed you train,” a professional dog handler tells us, “He’s like a human. You befriend him.” The dense, harsh coat is described as “neat but shaggy” and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs. The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it’s the Affenpinscher’s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.","Confident, Famously Funny, Fearless",148,22.86,29.21,3.17514659,4.5359237,12,15,Toy Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.6,Regular Exercise,0.8,Easy Training,1,Outgoing
Afghan Hound,"The Afghan Hound is an ancient breed, his whole appearance one of dignity and aloofness – his eyes gazing into the distance as if in memory of ages past.

The Afghan Hound is an athlete capable of immense speed and requires a large fenced in yard and exercise daily.Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed’s crowning glory isn’t just for show — it served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan’s glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile hound — standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder — built for a long day’s hunt. Their huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland’s punishing terrain.The Afghan Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, “It’s not the breed for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.” The Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified aristocrat of sublime beauty.

Alaskan Malamute,"The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, “I work hard for a living!” But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family “pack,” the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn’t respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around.

An immensely strong, heavy-duty worker of spitz type, the Alaskan Malamute is an affectionate, loyal, and playful but dignified dog recognizable by his well-furred plumed tail carried over the back, erect ears, and substantial bone.","Affectionate, Loyal, Playful",58,58.42,63.5,34.01942775,38.55535145,10,14,Working Group,0.6,2-3 Times a Week Brushing,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.4,Independent,0.8,Friendly
American Bulldog,"The American Bulldog is a descendant of the English Bulldog. It is believed that the bulldog was in America as early as the 17th century. They came to the United States in the 1800s, with immigrants who brought their working bulldogs with them. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs, and catch dogs. The breed largely survived, particularly in the southern states, due to its ability to bring down and catch feral pigs.The breed we know as the American Bulldog was originally known by many different names before the name American Bulldog became the standard. In different parts of the South he was known as the White English Southern Bulldog, but most commonly just “bulldog.” The breed was not called a bulldog because of a certain look, but because they did real bulldog work.

American English Coonhound,"Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, American English Coonhounds are deep-chested, sweet-faced athletes beloved by sportsmen for their speed and endurance. Stretched tightly across the athletic frame is a medium-length coat of various patterns, some with ticking. The head is broad with a domed skull, with soft, low-hung ears and dark-brown eyes that glow with warmth and kindness.American English Coonhounds are mellow when off duty but tenacious and stubborn in pursuit of their ring-tailed prey. Their work drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for things other than coon hunting, and their loud, ringing bark can make the breed a bad fit as house pets for novice owners.

American Eskimo Dog,"The American Eskimo Dog comes in three sizes—standard, miniature, and toy—standing as tall as 19 inches at the shoulder or as short as 9 inches.

American Foxhound,"American Foxhounds are sleek, rangy hunters known for their speed, endurance, and work ethic. You can tell the American Foxhound apart from their British cousin the English Foxhound by length of leg—the American’s legs are longer and more finely boned—and by the American’s slightly arched loin (back end). American Foxhounds have large, soft eyes with an expression described as gentle and pleading.So far, so good. But Foxhounds come with special considerations. They need lots of exercise or they can get depressed and destructive. A Foxhound’s single-minded prey drive must be managed. Their loud bawling is melodious to hound lovers but can be a nuisance to neighbors, and training and housebreaking these independent souls can be a steep challenge for novice owners. American Foxhounds are good-natured, low-maintenance hounds who get on well with kids, dogs, even cats, but come with special considerations for prospective owners. They are closely associated with Revolutionary heroes and the rolling estates of old Virginia.","Independent, Easy-Going, Sweet-Tempered",186,53.34,63.5,27.2155422,31.7514659,11,13,Hound Group,0.2,Occasional Bath/Brush,0.6,Seasonal,0.8,Energetic,0.4,Independent,0.8,Friendly
